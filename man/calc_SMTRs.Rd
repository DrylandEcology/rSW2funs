\usage{
calc_SMTRs(
  sim_in,
  sim_out = NULL,
  sim_agg = NULL,
  soil_TOC = NULL,
  has_soil_temperature = TRUE,
  opt_SMTR = list(aggregate_at = "conditions", crit_agree_frac = 0.9, use_normal =
    TRUE, SWP_dry = -1.5, SWP_sat = -0.033, impermeability = 0.9),
  simTime1 = NULL,
  simTime2 = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  msg_tag = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_in}{An object of class \code{\linkS4class{swInputData}}. The
\pkg{rSOILWAT2} simulation input.}

\item{sim_out}{An object of class \code{\linkS4class{swOutput}}. The
\pkg{rSOILWAT2} simulation output. If \code{NULL} then \code{sim_agg}
must be provided instead.}

\item{sim_agg}{A named list. The prepared \pkg{rSOILWAT2} simulation output.
If \code{NULL} then \code{sim_out} must be provided so that the elements
of \code{sim_agg} can be determined internally. The list contains:
\var{"soiltemp.dy.all"}, \var{"soiltemp.yr.all"}, \var{"soiltemp.mo.all"},
\var{"vwcmatric.dy.all"}, \var{"swpmatric.dy.all"}, \var{"prcp.yr"},
\var{"prcp.mo"}, \var{"pet.mo"}, and \var{"tmp.mo"}. Note:
if \code{sim_agg} has already been calculated for other reasons, then
passing \code{sim_agg} may be faster than passing \code{sim_out},
which (re-)calculates \code{sim_agg}.}

\item{soil_TOC}{A numeric vector. Total soil organic matter in g C / kg soil
for each soil layer. If \code{NULL}, then internally set to 0.}

\item{has_soil_temperature}{A logical value. Set to \code{TRUE}, if soil
temperature values have been simulated.}

\item{opt_SMTR}{A named list. Parameters for the calculation of the regimes:
\itemize{
  \item \code{aggregate_at}: A character string. Determines the approach
    for regime determination; we recommend the value of "conditions".
    See details.
  \item \code{crit_agree_frac}: A numeric value. The aggregation agreement
    level (e.g., 0.5 = majority; 1 = all); we recommend a value of 0.9.
  \item \code{use_normal}: A logical value. If \code{TRUE}, then
    "normal years" as defined by (Soil Survey Staff 2014: p.29) are
    determined (note: should be at least a time period of 30 years);
    if \code{FALSE}, then all years are used for the calculation of
    regimes. We recommend to determine "normal years".
  \item \code{SWP_dry}: A numeric value. Soil water potential (MPa)
    below which soils are considered dry; we recommend a value of -1.5 MPa.
  \item \code{SWP_sat}: A numeric value. Soil water potential (MPa)
    above which soils are considered saturated; we recommend a value
    of -0.033 MPa.
  \item \code{impermeability}: A numeric value. The value above which
    the code considers a soil layer to be impermeable. We recommend a
    value of 0.9.
}}

\item{simTime1}{A list with named elements. Calculated internally
if \code{NULL}; alternatively, it can be generated by a call to the
function \code{\link[rSW2data]{setup_time_simulation_run}}.}

\item{simTime2}{A list with named elements. Calculated internally
if \code{NULL}; alternatively, it can be generated by a call to the
function \code{\link[rSW2data]{simTiming_ForEachUsedTimeUnit}}.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value. If \code{TRUE} more messages are printed.}

\item{msg_tag}{A character string. Tag that is pre-appended to each verbose
message.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements: \itemize{
  \item \code{regimes_done}: if successful calculation of soil moisture and
    soil temperature regimes then \code{TRUE} otherwise \code{FALSE}
  \item \code{has_simulated_SoilTemp}: if soil temperature was simulated
    then \code{1} otherwise \code{0}
  \item \code{has_realistic_SoilTemp}: if simulated soil temperature values
    are realistic then \code{1} otherwise \code{0}
  \item \code{has_Ohorizon}: if soil profile may have an O-horizon, then
    \code{TRUE} otherwise \code{FALSE}
  \item \code{Lanh_depth}: a numeric vector of length two
  \item \code{MCS_depth}: a numeric vector of length two
  \item \code{Fifty_depth}: a numeric value
  \item \code{permafrost_yrs}: number of years with permafrost conditions
  \item \code{SMR_normalyears}: years considered "normal"
  \item \code{SMR_normalyears_N}: number of years considered "normal"
  \item \code{cond_annual}: a numeric matrix with annual values of
    underlying conditions used to determine soil moisture and soil
    temperature regimes
  \item \code{STR}: soil temperature regimes
  \item \code{SMR}: soil moisture regimes
}

\description{
Calculations are based on SSS (2014, 2015) and explained in detail in the
\code{vignette(
  topic = "SoilMoistureRegimes_SoilTemperatureRegimes",

)}.

\section{Details}{
 The argument \code{aggregate_at} determines at which level
  aggregations to regimes are carried out: \itemize{
  \item \code{data}: Determine conditions and regimes based on aggregated
    mean soil moisture/temperature values.
  \item \code{conditions} Determine conditions based on time-series values
    of soil moisture/temperature values; determine regimes based on
    aggregated mean conditions.
  \item \code{regime}: Determine conditions and regimes based on
    time-series values of soil moisture/temperature values.
