# How to use rSOILWAT2 to calculate SMRs and STRs

## Install a sufficiently recent rSOILWAT2 package version:
```{r, install, results = "hide"}
  v <- try(utils::packageVersion("rSOILWAT2"), silent = TRUE)
  if (inherits(v, "try-error") || v < "2.5.0") {
    message(
      "There is no or an outdated rSOILWAT2 version present. ",
      "Please update to a more recent version and build vignettes: see",
      "https://github.com/DrylandEcology/rSOILWAT2#installation"
    )
  }

  stopifnot(require("rSOILWAT2", quietly = TRUE))
```

## Load data and run rSOILWAT2 simulation
```{r, simulate}
  # Load data for an example site: see ?sw_exampleData
  sw_in <- rSOILWAT2::sw_exampleData
  # Run SOILWAT2 for the example site: see ?sw_exec
  sw_out <- sw_exec(inputData = sw_in)
```


## Calculate SMRs and STRs and underlying conditions for the example site
```{r, SMTRs, collapse = TRUE}
  # For more information, see ?calc_SMTRs
  SMTR <- calc_SMTRs(sim_in = sw_in, sim_out = sw_out)

  # Check that simulation was successful and regimes could be identified:
  stopifnot(as.logical(SMTR[c("regimes_done", "has_simulated_SoilTemp",
    "has_realistic_SoilTemp")]), SMTR[["SMR_normalyears_N"]] > 2)

  # Take average across years and select regimes with more than 90% agreement
  crit_agree_frac <- 0.9
  x <- SMTR[["cond_annual"]]

  # --> Soil temperature regime is "Cryic"
  Tregime <- colMeans(SMTR[["STR"]]) >= crit_agree_frac
  print(Tregime)

  # --> Soil moisture regime is "Ustic" / "Typic-Tempustic"
  Sregime <- colMeans(SMTR[["SMR"]]) >= crit_agree_frac
  print(Sregime)
```


###  Explore the conditions that define the [cryic](#Cryic) STR:
```{r, cryic, collapse = TRUE}
  # The STR of the example site is cryic because:
  cryic <-
    #   - there is no permafrost:
    SMTR[["permafrost_yrs"]] == 0 &&

    #   - annual soil temperature at 50-cm depth is between 0 and 8 C:
    mean(x[, "MAT50"] > 0 & x[, "MAT50"] < 8) >= crit_agree_frac &&

    #  - soil is not saturated with water during some part of the summer:
    mean(x[, "CSPartSummer"] == 0) >= crit_agree_frac &&

    #  - soil does not have an O-horizon:
    !SMTR[["has_Ohorizon"]] &&

    #  - summer soil temperature at 50-cm depth is below 15 C:
    mean(x[, "T50jja"] < 15) >= crit_agree_frac

  print(cryic)
```


### Explore the conditions that define the [ustic](#ustic) SMR:
```{r, ustic, collapse = TRUE}
  # The SMR of the example site is ustic because:
  ustic <-
    #   - there is no permafrost:
    SMTR[["permafrost_yrs"]] == 0 &&

    #   - moisture control section is not dry for less than 90 cumulative days
    !(mean(x[, "COND3"]) >= crit_agree_frac) &&

    #   - annual soil temperature at 50-cm depth is not more than 22 C
    !(mean(x[, "COND4"]) >= crit_agree_frac) &&

    #   - soils are not completely dry for more than half the days of the year
    #     when soil temperature ato 50-cm depth is more than 5 C
    !(mean(x[, "COND1"]) >= crit_agree_frac) &&

    #   - soils are not moist for more than 45 consecutive days following
    #     the winter soltice
    !(mean(x[, "COND9"]) >= crit_agree_frac)

  print(ustic)

  # The SMR of the example site is typic-tempustic because:
  typic_tempustic <-
    #   - SMR is ustic
    ustic &&

    #   - soils are not moist for more than 45 consecutive days following
    #     the winter soltice
    !(mean(x[, "COND9"]) >= crit_agree_frac)

  print(typic_tempustic)
```


### Determine resilience and resistance (RR) categories:

  Note: cryic/ustic conditions have not been included by
  (Chambers et al. 2014)^[\ref{def:Chambers2014}]^ or
  (Maestas et al. 2016)^[\ref{def:Maestas2016}]^.

```{r, rr, collapse = TRUE}
  # Determine resilience & resistance classes (sensu Chambers et al. 2014):
  clim <- calc_SiteClimate(weatherList = get_WeatherHistory(sw_in))
  RR <- calc_RRs_Chambers2014(Tregime, Sregime, MAP_mm = 10 * clim[["MAP_cm"]])
  print(RR)

  # Determine resilience & resistance classes (sensu Maestas et al. 2016):
  RR <- calc_RRs_Maestas2016(Tregime, Sregime)
  print(RR)
```

# Notes
* The rest of the vignette explains how rSOILWAT2 has implemented the
  calculations of soil moisture regime (SMR) and soil temperature regime (STR)
  and compares the logic with the 'Java Newhall Simulation Model' (jNSM) and
  with the 'Keys to Soil Taxonomy' (SSS 2014)^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^.
* Quoted text is directly from SSS (2014)^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^. So direction of
  a logic may be opposite of a condition, which will be indicated by \! before
  the condition.
* jNSM calculations can be found at end of this document. Line numbers refer
  to file 'BASICSimulationModel.java' (jNSM 2016^[\ref{def:jNSM2016}]^).



# Definitions of conditions
Our interpretations of SSS (2014)^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^ -- language refers to
soil layers, not parts

* __Dry__ := soil water potential < -1.5 MPa "the moisture tension is 1500
  kPa or more" (p. 29, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)
* __Moist/wet__ := soil water potential >= -1.5 MPa "water is held at a tension
  of less than 1500 kPa but more than zero"
  (p. 29, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)
* __Saturated__ := soil water potential >= -0.033 MPa

* \label{def:histic_epipedon} __Histic epipedon__ := a horizon that is
  periodically saturated with water and that has sufficiently high amounts of
  organic carbon (O.C. 12 to 18%, by weight, depending on clay content) to be
  considered organic soil material. Typically, it is at (or near) the surface
  and is peat or muck at least 20 cm thick."
  (p.3-10, SSS 2015^[\ref{def:SSS2015}]^)
* \label{def:Ohorizon} __O-horizon__ := "Horizons [...] dominated by
  organic soil materials. [...] Some O horizons [...] consist of slightly
  decomposed to highly decomposed litter, such as leaves, needles, twigs,
  moss, and lichens, that has been deposited on the surface of either mineral
  or organic soils." (p. 335, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)
* \label{def:OSM} __Organic soil material (OSM)__ := "Soil material that
  contains more than the amounts of organic carbon described above for mineral
  soil material is considered organic soil material"
  (p. 3, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)
* \label{def:MSM} __Mineral soil material (MSM)__ := "(less than 2.0 mm in
  diameter) _either_:
    1) Is saturated with water for less than 30 days (cumulative) per year in
       normal years and contains less than 20 percent (by weight) organic
       carbon; _or_
    2) Is saturated with water for 30 days or more (cumulative) in normal years
       (or is artificially drained) and, excluding live roots, has an organic
       carbon content (by weight) of:
        * Less than 18 percent if the mineral fraction contains 60 percent or
          more clay; _or_
        * Less than 12 percent if the mineral fraction contains no clay; _or_
        * Less than 12 + (clay percentage multiplied by 0.1) percent if the
          mineral fraction contains less than 60 percent clay."
          (p. 3, SSS 2014^[\ref{def:SSS2014}]^)

soil temperatures differ by less than 6 C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic,
lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower", which is applicable to
